infinite while loop
	if slide switch is off

		turn off buzzer
		BILED set to red

		for loop for 3 players 
			read the potentiometer input
			calculate the wait time
			calculate the strum time
			start timer
			turn on buzzer for ~0.2 seconds
			for loop for 8 turns
				generate random number between 1-7
				convert the decimal number into binary, store in array
				light the corresponding LEDs based on the binary number for the wait time
				record counter value

					wait until the strum button is pressed
					record counter value

						record as correct for corresponding player

						record as incorrect for corresponding player
