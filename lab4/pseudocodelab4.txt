	if slideswitch 1 is on
		after 80 ms, update the ranger reading
		drive the motor
	if slideswitch 1 is off
		set the motor to neutral

		after 40 ms, update the compass reading
		calculate the error from the compass reading
		steer the wheels
	if slideswitch 2 is off
		set the wheels straight

Drive Motor code:
if the range is equal to 30 cm
	set the motors to neutral
if the range is less than 30 cm
	set the motors to reverse to maintain a 30 cm range
if the range is greater than 30 cm
	set the motors to a constant forward speed

if the error is greater than 180
	turn the wheels in the opposite direction
if the error is less than 180
